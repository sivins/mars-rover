# Mars Rover

See included Postman collection or SwaggerGen for usage examples.

## Input

Assume the southwest corner of the grid is 0,0 (the origin). The first
line of input establishes the exploration grid bounds by indicating the
coordinates corresponding to the northeast corner of the plateau.
Next, each rover is given its instructions in turn. Each rover’s
instructions consists of two lines of strings. The first string confirms
the rover’s current position and heading. The second string consists of
turn / move instructions.

## Output

Once each rover has received and completely executed its given
instructions, it transmits its updated position and heading to NASA.
